usage: window-marker [-h] [-m KEYBINDING] [-g KEYBINDING]

Vim-like marks for windows.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m KEYBINDING, --mark KEYBINDING
                        keybinding to add a mark (default: Mod4-m)
  -g KEYBINDING, --goto KEYBINDING
                        keybinding to goto a mark (default Mod4-apostrophe)

Using window-marker is exactly like using marks in vim. Namely, by pressing
the keybinding for "mark", window-marker then listens for one more letter
(a-z) to be entered. Whichever letter is entered will now be associated with
the active window. 

If you now want to go back to that window (even if you're
on a different desktop), simply press the keybinding for "goto" and then enter
the letter you used to mark the window. 

To set your own keybinding, please
consult /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h and the output of `xmodmap`. The `xev`
program may also be useful.
