INSTALL
-------
There is no install; simply run 'window-marker'.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
The current package of xpyb 1.2 is extremely out of date and will not
work with window-marker. You'll need either xpyb-git (from the official
freedesktop.org repository[1]) or xpyb-ng-git. Both should work.

Installing xpyb-ng-git should be as simple as 'python2 setup.py install'.

To install xpyb-git (from freedesktop.org), use something like this:

  export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2 # Only if python is a python3 binary
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install
