It should be as straight-forward as

  sudo python2 setup.py install

Two configuration files, config.py and keybind.py will be copied to 
/etc/xdg/pytyle3. 

To configure pytyle3 on a user basis, create ~/.config/pytyle3 and copy 
/etc/xdg/pytyle3/*py to that directory.

pytyle3 will require a restart if the configuration has changed.
